\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 5 questions.
  \item Include code, images, and equations where appropriate.
  \item Please make this document anonymous.
  \item When you are finished, compile this document to a PDF and submit it directly to Gradescope. On upload, \textbf{Gradescope will ask you to assign question numbers to your pages}. Making each question end with a page break after your answer is a good way to ease this process.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}

\paragraph{Q1:} Image convolution, a type of image filtering, is a fundamental image processing tool that you will use repeatedly throughout the course.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Explicitly describe the 3 main components of image convolution:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item input
    \item transformation
    \item output
\end{enumerate}
\item Why is image convolution important in Computer Vision?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Q2:} Correlation is another basic image operation. Correlation and convolution are, in some sense, the simplest operations we can perform to extract information from images.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
    What is the difference between convolution and correlation?

    \item
    Construct a scenario which produces a different output between both operations. Include the kernel you used and your results.
    
    \emph{Please use \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.convolve.html}{$scipy.ndimage.convolve$} and \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.correlate.html}{$scipy.ndimage.correlate$} to experiment!}

\paragraph{Q3:} A hybrid image is created by applying a high pass filter on one image, a low pass filter on another image, and then summing the two images together. For questions (a) through (c), fill in the box for whether the kernel corresponds to a high pass filter, a low pass filter, or neither. For questions (d) and (e), the images are outputs of a filtering operation with high pass or low pass filters. Fill in the box indicating what kernel was used for the result.

\emph{LaTeX:} To fill in boxes, replace `\textbackslash square' with `\textbackslash blacksquare' for your answer.

$\square$ & A Gaussian filter is an example of a low pass filter \\
$\square$ & A high pass filter is the basis for most smoothing methods \\
$\square$ & In a high pass filter, the center of the kernel must have the highest value \\

\paragraph{Q4:} 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
How does computation time vary with filter sizes from $3\times3$ to $15\times15$ (test odd and square sizes, i.e. $3\times3$, $5\times5$, $7\times7$, etc.), and with image sizes from 0.25~MPix to 8~MPix? Choose your own intervals. 

Measure both using \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.convolve.html}{$scipy.ndimage.convolve$} or \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.correlate.html}{$scipy.ndimage.correlate$} to produce a matrix of values. Use the \href{http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/transform/plot_rescale.html}{$skimage.transform$} module to vary the size of an image. Use an appropriate charting function to plot your matrix of results, such as \href{https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/toolkits/mplot3d.html#scatter-plots}{$Axes3D.scatter$} or \href{https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/toolkits/mplot3d.html#surface-plots}{$Axes3D.plot\textrm{\_}surface$}.

\emph{Image:} \href{RISDance.jpg}{RISDance.jpg} (in the .tex directory).

\item
    Do the results match your expectation given the number of multiply and add operations in convolution?

\paragraph{Q5:} 
In 1990, \emph{New York Times} photography critic Andy Grundberg \href{https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/12/arts/photography-view-ask-it-no-questions-the-camera-can-lie.html}{stated that:}\\``In the future, readers of newspapers and
magazines will probably view news pictures more as
illustrations than as reportage, since they can no longer distinguish between a genuine image and one that has been manipulated.''

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item When is Grundberg's `future' ? Why? (2--4 sentences)
    
    \item When is a news picture no longer genuine? Are any manipulations permissible, and if so, which ones? (2--4 sentences)
    
    \item If you worked for the \emph{New York Times} and were tasked with maintaining readers' trust in news pictures in Grundberg's future, what would you do? Consider everything that happens in the publication of a news picture. Describe your approach, and why it would work. (3--5 sentences)
    
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item As per c), but instead you worked for the \emph{College Hill Independent}? \\(2--4 sentences)
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Include an example of a manipulated news picture, and identify the manipulation. What was the intent and impact of the manipulation? (2--4 sentences)
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Note:} There are open questions. We will grade for thought and justification.
